---------------------------------------------
GCM (Galois Counter Mode) mode (AES-GCM)

A combination of Counter mode (CTR) and Authentication. Uses a Message Authentication Code (MAC) for authentication/integrity.

Pros:
    - Guarantees integrity (to establish if the ciphertext was modified in transit or if it really originates from a certain source)
    - Accepts pipelined and parallelized implementations and have a minimal computational footprint

Cons:
    - Complex implementation.

---------------------------------------------
The AES-GCM encryption takes as input a (message) + (encryption key) and produces as output a set of values: { ciphertext + nonce + authTag }.
(1) The ciphertext: is the encrypted message.
(2) The nonce: is the randomly generated initial vector (IV) for the GCM construction.
(3) The authTag: is the message authentication code (MAC) calculated during the encryption and used to check ciphertext's intigrity.

The encryption key size generated in the code is 256 bits (32 bytes) and it configures the AES-GCM cipher as AES-256-GCM. 

If we change something before the decryption (e.g. the ciphertext of the IV), we will get and exception, because the message integrity will be broken
